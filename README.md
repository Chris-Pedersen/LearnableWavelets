# Wavelets
Play around with Gaussian random fields and wavelets. Apply scattering networks to CAMELs fields and compare inference with standard CNN. Uses `pytorch` and `kymatio`. Most of the `models` code is lifted from https://github.com/bentherien/ParametricScatteringNetworks/

Will require you to set the path to the CAMELs dataset as an environment variable `export CAMELS_PATH="/path/to/CAMELS/data"`
